camel-spring-boot: demonstrates using Camel with Spring Boot in a Java Container
================================================================================


This example demonstrates how you can use Apache Camel with Spring Boot in a [Java Container](http://fabric8.io/gitbook/javaContainer.html)


Before building and running this quick start you need:

* Maven 3.0.4 or higher
* JDK 1.8

This is an example of processing of "banking card transaction routing to several processors".
Example built on enterprise messaging pattern framework called Apache Camel (www.camel.apche.org)
It's just an example created with the concern of estimation of Camel framework's effectivity for solving "routing" functions.  
 

To build from the source code:

1. Change your working directory to `test0` directory.
1. Run `mvn clean install camel:run` to build the quickstart.
